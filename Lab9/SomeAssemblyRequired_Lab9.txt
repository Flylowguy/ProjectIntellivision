Part 1:
  1. Control flags are data that are passed into the control unit that decide the behavior of the operation being
      performed, they also provide state information about the processor's last operation (NZVC).

  2. An add instruction will set alu_op, a_inv, b_inv and write enable.

Part 2:
  1. With the statement END IF

  2. To prevent lockouts and to ake sure that instructions are properly timed.
   By keeping actions on the rising edge of the clock we prevent large scale data loss or misordered instructions.

   3. IF(rising_edge(Clock)) THEN

   4.
	  IF(x = "01") THEN
		  y <= "00";
	  ELSIF(x = "10") THEN
		  y <= "01";
	  ELSE THEN
		  x <= "00";
	  END IF;

Part 3:
  1. The ALU.

  2. alu_op = "01"

  3. Then the stage is reset to 1.

  4. rf_write, which is the write enable signal.
